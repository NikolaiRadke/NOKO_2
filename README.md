NOKO is a multifunctional monster with an ATmega328  microcontroller on an **Arduino Nano**, display, clock, radio, mp3 player, four buttons as user interface, battery, voice set and  tons of gimmicks, packed in a cuddly monster suit - sturdy,
lovely and sometimes a bit mean and annoying. Just the way you want him to be. He, she or it - this is your decision     and only depends on the voice set. In this repository NOKO is a lad, a real bloke! A buddy for life and a companion by day and night. All he needs is a little power every now and then.  

**NOKO** stands for **NO**ra and ni**KO**'s monster.

### Notes for non-German NOKO makers
There are a German and an English version. Right now, the building wiki, the voice set, the manual and the optional EEPROM text files are in German. I'll try to translate the wiki and the manual one day. Until then, feel free to ask me for translation, if you need help. **Contribute!** I need an English voice set and English text files. In addition, any other language is welcome, NOKO is to be cosmopolitan!

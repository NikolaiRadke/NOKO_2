This is a library wrapper and a few extras to the excellent code produced
by Nathan Seidle from Sparkfun (Beerware).

Nathan's comments......
Look for serial output at 57600bps.
The Si4703 ACKs the first byte, and NACKs the 2nd byte of a read.
1/18 - after much hacking, I suggest NEVER write to a register without first reading the contents of a chip.
ie, don't updateRegisters without first readRegisters.
The Si4703 breakout does work with line out into a stereo or other amplifier. Be sure to test with different length 3.5mm
cables. Too short of a cable may degrade reception.

Nikolai's comments...
This Library was slightly modified for use with NOKO. Thanks to Nathan's great RDS text funtion. Function delay() is
used by this library. However, NOKO uses newdelay() to save a lot of flash space. So newdelay() was
added. 

si4703_init()       Modified for NOKO with direct port manipulation
newdelay()          Was added - safes flash!
powerOff()          Was added
setSoftMuteOff()    Was added (but unused)
setSoftMuteOn()     Was added (but unused)
Set to STEREO       Line 174 in Si4703.cpp
readRDS             Was modified for polling without timeout
readRDS_RadioTtext  The same

Maybe one day I will test RDS performance mode?

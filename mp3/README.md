The male Noko was spoken by my fellow actor [Carsten Caniglia](https://filmmakers.de/carsten-caniglia). Why? 
He has done a great job - moreover I don't want to listen to my own voice every day, especially when development takes more than a year! (Ian said I sound really weird in real life. Thanks, mate.)  
  
The female Noko was spoken by [Norma Anthes](https://norma-anthes.de/Norma_Anthes/).
